			<h2>What Is a Hydroxyl Generator and Air Purifier?</h2>
			<p>HGI engineers have worked tirelessly to completely revolutionize home and commercial air purifiers and hydroxyl generators, to which the average air purification system simply does not compare. The CleanArc Power Air Purifiers and Hydroxyl Generators are non-chemical devices that provide an environmentally safe and scientifically proven solution for removing odors and destroying viruses, bacteria, disease, allergens, and other contaminants. Better yet, our air mitigation systems are FDA-approved and average 99.99% effectiveness in killing most known viruses, bacteria, black mold, and other harmful air pollutants by sanitizing not only the indoor air, but also surfaces.</p>

	<h2>How Does the CleanArc Power Hydroxyl Generator and Air Purifier Work?</h2>
	<p>CleanArc Power Hydroxyl Generator Technology replicates the Sun’s natural UV irradiation process to completely transform water vapor into a natural cascade of “hydroxyl” and other free radical oxidants, thus neutralizing organic and inorganic contaminants, bacteria, viruses, and mold in the air and on surfaces.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>The chain reaction caused by a cascade of organic oxidizing agents is stable enough to react with nearly all organic chemicals and many inorganic chemicals throughout the entire treatment space. The hydroxyl generator directs the contaminated air inside the unit where the synthetic ultraviolet rays go to work to purify the air and prevent viruses, microorganisms, and other contaminants from multiplying again. The safe, purified, and deodorized air is then released back into the room or building. As long as the system is in operation, chain reactions continue, ensuring a constant flow of hydroxyls — and safer, healthier air.</p>

	<h2>What Are the Benefits of Air Purifiers and Hydroxyl Generato</h2>
	<p>The benefits of CleanArc Power Hydroxyl Generators and Air Purifiers are limitless. Let’s explore the advantages of rapid and sustained solutions for safely treating viruses, allergens, bacteria, odors, and other air pollutants.</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>Airborne viruses can contaminate the air in literally any setting, be it a home, an office, a warehouse, even a super hygienic medical facility. The trouble is, airborne viruses can enter the air in a room via a cough, a sneeze, even turning the page in a book, and then that virus is carried and dispersed through different air movements, allowing the virus to continually cycle through the air and contaminate surfaces.</p>
			<p>Airborne illnesses transmitted through the air include colds and flu, and more serious illnesses such as H1N1, SARS, and COVID-19. The key to purifying and decontaminating a room or even a whole building is through excellent ventilation and treating the contaminated air with an effective hydroxyl air purification system.</p>

			<p>So how does the CleanArc Hydroxyl Generator and Air Purifier work to eliminate viruses in the air and on surfaces in these and other types of settings? The science is simple, really. As the strategically placed hydroxyl generator directs the contaminated air into the unit, the system replicates the sun’s powerful UV rays to neutralize viruses and free-radicals from the air. During this process, the hydroxyls rapidly kill 99.99% of the viruses in the air and on surfaces by breaking down the virus’ molecular structure while preventing them from multiplying. The safe, virus-free air is then released back into the room. The new clean air then regenerates new organic oxidants through the cascade effect described earlier, ensuring a constant stream of safer, healthier air for you, your family, your employees, and your patrons to breathe. As a result, both homeowners and business owners can feel confident in the effectiveness and efficiency of our scientifically proven hydroxyl generators and air purifiers.</p>

	<h2>Air Purifiers for Allergens</h2>
	<p>One of the most frequent questions we hear at Capsells is, “Do air purifiers help with allergens?” and the simple answer is “yes.” The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) reports that allergies caused by airborne pollutants are some of the most common chronic conditions affecting people of all ages globally. Common allergens make their way into homes and businesses via open windows, HVAC systems, and we even carry them inside on our clothes and other surfaces. As these pollutants circulate through the indoor air, they reduce the indoor air quality and fall onto surfaces. These allergens can cause an array of irritating and miserable symptoms for both people and pets, such as itchy, watery eyes, runny nose, irritated skin, and cough, to name a few. Not only that, but these irritants can also cause more serious and even life-threatening reactions such as anaphylaxis, and can become increasingly dangerous for people who have compromised immune systems, or who have chronic respiratory issues such as asthma.</p>

				<p>When you think about how much time we spend indoors where we live, work, and play, and then combine that duration of time spent indoors with poor air quality being trapped inside of say, a home, office, or restaurant, then it’s no wonder that these allergens can negatively affect our immune and respiratory health. So how can CleanArc Hydroxyl Generators and Air Purifiers rapidly treat the air, thereby, significantly reducing the populations of allergens in your indoor air?</p>
				<p>Just like Capsells air filter machines work to eliminate airborne viruses, these air purifiers and hydroxyl generators have been scientifically proven to reduce common allergen air pollutants by 99.99%, improving the safety and health of indoor environments in both small and large spaces.</p>

		<p>As the generator pulls in the contaminated air, it breaks apart the molecular structure of allergen contaminants, cleans the air particles, and then pushes the purified air back out into a room. These patented hydroxyl units are strategically placed in homes and businesses to create a continuous flow of new hydroxyls both inside and outside of the generator to ensure the cascade effect for safer, cleaner air. This cycle continues as the hydroxyl generator is active, constantly improving the air quality in your home or office, and thereby improving your quality of life.</p>
