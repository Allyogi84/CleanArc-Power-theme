				<h2>How Do Solar-Powered Streets Light Work, Exactly?</h2>
				<p>Designed for simple installation as a single integrated unit, Capsells solar lights are proudly assembled in the USA. Using the latest LED technology, our powerful solar lights come in different lumen options (1,500-16,000 Lumen), capable of illuminating large areas like streets, parking lots, commercial spaces, walkways, pathways, parks, and other spaces. But how do solar street lights work? Check it out!</p>

					<h4>Solar LED Technology</h4>
					<p>Unlike traditional street lights that are plugged into the grid, solar street lights are equipped with an integrated system that generates power directly from the sun’s rays. Just like other solar-powered systems, solar street lights have embedded solar panels made of photovoltaic solar cells that harness and absorb solar energy and convert it into usable electric energy to illuminate the street light. These smart lighting systems are completely customizable, with a wireless programming system that is fully automatic and programmable.</p>

					<h4>Why Is a Battery Necessary?</h4>
					<p>A solar battery ensures the solar light’s ability to store energy and recharge the LED lights to generate long-lasting power and sustainable illumination. With a lifespan of 5-8 years, the LiFePO4 batteries have a working time of up to four nights on a full charge. Overall maintenance is almost zero with no bulb changes and LEDs that generate a lifetime of 50,000 hours.</p>

		<h2>Our LED Solar-Powered Street Lights</h2>
		<p>You have a wide array of options to choose from when it comes to our solar street lights. Each system has a different amount of lumens (# of lumens per watt of energy), which is the amount of illumination produced by each street light. The higher the lumens, the more light your system will produce, which is meant to maximize your energy savings. Learn more about lumens versus watts in our recent article</p>
